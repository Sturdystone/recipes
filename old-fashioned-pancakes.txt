Ingredients

    Ingredients (doubled amts in parentheses):
    1-1/2 (3) cups flour
    3-1/2 (7) tsp baking powder
    1 (2) tsp salt
    1 (2) tbsp sugar
    ......
    1 (2) egg
    3 (6) tbsp butter, melted
    1-1/2 (3) cups whole milk
    .....
    1/4-1/2 (1/2-1) tsp vanilla
    .....
    8 (16) tbsp pancake syrup (2 tsp per pancake)


Directions
(Note: It's best to use room temperature eggs and milk, so feel free to let them sit out on the counter awhile before you begin the recipe.)

1 - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.

2 - In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter, and milk just till they are fully blended and slightly bubbly. Don't over-whisk because that toughens up the eggs.

3 - Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture. Whisk briefly, just until dry ingredients are absorbed, but with batter remaining a little lumpy. Do not over-mix!!!

4 - Let sit for 5-15 min so nice air bubbles can develop. Do not re-stir!!! Treat the batter with as little extra movement as possible. Meanwhile, pre-heat griddle to 350.

5 - Spray griddle with cooking spray. Pour batter onto griddle using a 1/4 cup measuring cup or small ladle. Brown on both sides.

Makes 12 large pancakes (6 servings of two each).
